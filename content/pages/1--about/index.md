Hi, I'm Lokesh Devnani. I'm a software engineer who loves products, computer science and dancing.

I like to let myself out there, to challenge myself and play around with things out of my comfort zone. Understanding software & data systems at scale is the area I find myself delving into most these days. Also, I'm very passionate about dancing and exploring contemporary movement nowadays. I love exploring body movement & various cultures through music.

I'm currently working with [Clarisights](https://clarisights.com/), where we are building a decision platform incorporating realtime, interactive and contextual reporting for performance marketing teams. See [/now](/now) for more on what I'm busy doing these days.

Besides all that, I seek out to try different experiences. There's nothing I hate more than mediocrity. Carpe Diem.

If you feel like discussing some ideas or just hanging out sometime, get in [touch](/contact).
