Hi, I'm Lokesh Devnani.

I'm a software engineer with a curious mind. I'm currently working with [Clarisights](https://clarisights.com/), where we are building a decision platform incorporating realtime, interactive and contextual reporting for performance marketing teams.

I like to learn & play around with various domains. Understanding software & data systems at scale is the area I find myself delving into most. Also, I'm very passionate about dancing & I make time for it daily. I love exploring body movement & various cultures through music.
Besides all that, I seek out to try different experiences. I believe in `Live it up, YOLO ðŸ¤Ÿ`.

If you feel like discussing some ideas or just hanging out sometime, drop in a message. â˜®
